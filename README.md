**Where Should I live?**

Moving to a new place is a prospect many will face at least once during their lives. These changes represent long term emotional and financial investment risk. The risk of choosing
poorly could lead to significant financial and quality of life consequences.

In this project, we build a Visualization tool in Tableau to help make a decision on where should we live. The user is asked to select their preference on 6 features namely Affordability, Crime, Education level, Population, Temperature and Unemployment and also select relative importance for each of these features.

We take historical data for each of these features, build an end to end machine learning pipeline for the below mentioned algorithms, choose the best Algorithm based on fit for each of these features and predict the future trend. 

The following are the various forecasting algorithms that was implemented:

1. XGBoosting regression
2. Random forest regression
3. KNN Regression
4. Support Vector Regression
5. Linear Regression
6. Holt's method
7. Simple exponential smoothing
8. Holt's winter method
9. Facebook's prophet package
